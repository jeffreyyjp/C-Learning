/* Write a program that creates a structure template with two members according to the following criteria:
    a. The first member is a social security number. The second member is a structure with three members. Its first member contains a first name, its seconds member contains a middle name, and its final member contains a last name. Create and initialize an array of five such structures. Have the program print the data in this format:
    Dribble, Flossie M. - 302039823

Only the initial letter of the middle name is printed, and a period is added. Neither the initial(of course) nor the period should be printed if the middle name member is empty. Write a function to do the printing; pass the structure array to the function.
    b. Modify part a. by passing the structure value instead of the address. */
