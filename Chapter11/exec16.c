/* Write a program that reads input until end-of-file and echoes it to the display. Have the program recognize and implement the following command-line-argument:
-p      Print input as is
-u      Map input to all uppercase
-l      Map input to all lowercase

Also, if there are no command-line arguments, let the program behave as if the -p argument had been used. */
